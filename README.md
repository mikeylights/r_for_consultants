## R for Consultants
This project is a repo for any professional that needs to quickly get up to speed on R. Included is a collection of vignettes that show how to implement various techniques and packages, improving your ability to use R.

## Current Vignettes 
- **dtplyr** -- an elegant way to use data.table as a backend when writing dplyr syntax for wrangling
- **sparklyr** -- a method for distributed computing while leveraging dplyr syntax (vignette shows effective wrangling of ~30m rows)
- **group_walk** -- an elegant way automatically split a dataframe by a factor variable and export each subset
- **big data chunking** -- an automated method to apply the same transformation to separate/identical data sets in an iterative fashion
