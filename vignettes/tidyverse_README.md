# Introduction 
Tidyverse offers a standard grammar for most aspects of data science. While the computational efficiency of Tidyverse may not maximize speed, the readability of the code offers benefits that I feel outweight the need for efficiency.

# Getting Started
In this vignette, I want to show consultants how to take their data and perform most of the actions they are used to relying on Excel for:
- importing data
- choosing columns
- sorting data
- adding new columns for calculations or based on logic
- pivoting data
- manipulating character columns
- concatenating and splitting columns based on separators
- writing out files (.tsv, .csv)
