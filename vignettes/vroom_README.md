# Introduction 
Vroom makes importing data incredibly fast!!!! Use this vignette to compare it to fread.

# Getting Started
- **IMPORTANT** - make sure to step through the script instead of source it as the smallest df loaded has ~ 2 million rows.

# Contribute
Vroom has many other capabilities to include:
- storing the name of the file path as a variable in the df after a multi-file import
- column selection and typing
- writing out files (.tsv, .csv)
